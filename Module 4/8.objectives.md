The app is not dockerized, making it less portable and harder to deploy consistently across different environments.
The Postgres database is running on the same instance as the app, which is a single point of failure and limits performance.
The app is not highly available. If the single instance fails, the whole app is down.
The app doesn't scale horizontally, which means it can't handle increases in traffic by adding more instances.
