1. Copy the file Dockerfile into the root of the project (it should be the folder simple-aws-nodejs-app)
2. Open a terminal in that folder, and run the command inside the docker-build.sh file
3. Run the command inside the docker-run.sh file
4. Run the commands inside the docker-logs.sh file
5. Run the commands inside the docker-stop.sh file

Tip: Read the commands, don't just run the scripts, so you know what they're doing =)
